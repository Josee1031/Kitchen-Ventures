      <h3>What is a Stuffed Mofongo?</h3>

      <p>
        Mofongo is a Puerto Rican staple dish. Relatively easy to make yet big
        on FLAVOR! In a nutshell, you’re just lightly pan-frying plantains and
        mashing them with a few simple ingredients.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s their mashed potatoes but with much more flair! It’s made with
        green plantains (savory bananas), mashed garlic and crunchy chicharron
        (fried pork rinds). It’s rooted in the West African dish fufu where yams
        or plantains are boiled and pounded into a doughlike consistency then
        rolled into balls and eaten.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has a consistency that is neither too soft or too hard sitting
        somewhere in between mashed potatoes and chunky potato salad. Once
        mashed the plantains are molded into the shape of a bowl or ramekin and
        then stuffed with garlic and bacon in its simplest form.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fresh herbs, onions, etc. may appear in different regional or familial
        versions. In this form mashed plantains are typically a side, but when
        stuffed or topped with braised meats or seafood it becomes mofongo
        relleno, a main entree.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my version, I create a mofongo relleno de camarones which is Mofongo
        topped with shrimp and roasted red pepper sauce.

      <h3>
        <strong>How To Make Mofongo w/ Shrimp</strong>
      </h3>

      <h4>Step 1: Prep the plantains</h4>
      <p>
        Cut the ends of the plantains, peel them and cut into 1-inch thick
        pieces and let them soak in salted water for 15 minutes. Drain the
        plantains and dry them very well.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Brown the plantains</h4>
      <p>
        Cook in hot oil about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the discs have
        turned a darker golden color but have not yet browned (do not let them
        brown!).You should be able to easily pierce them with a fork when they
        are ready. NOTE: Make sure there is sufficient fat in the pan, add
        additional if the plantains soak up too much.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3: Prepare the vegetables</h4>
      <p>
        Add bacon to frying pan and cook 5 minutes then add the onions and
        peppers, stirring occasionally. Cook until bacon is crisp and onion is
        soft and caramelized a bit.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: Make the mofongo mix</h4>
      <p>
        Using a mortar & pestle of large bowl + potato masher - mash plantains
        then add minced garlic, spices, and cilantro. Next add in the bacon,
        onions, peppers, and pan grease. Knead until well mixed but not
        overmixed.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h4>Step 5: Plate the mofongo</h4>
      <p>
        Spray inside of a small bowl or ramekin with cooking spray or grease
        with oil. Pack a portion of the plantain dough into the bowl to shape
        it, then invert the bowl to slide the mofongo out onto a plate. Press
        the top of the mofongo with your thumb to create a small crevasse.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 6: Cook the shrimp</h4>
      <p>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil then fry the
        shrimp 2 minutes per side
      </p>

      <h4>Step 7: Finish the dish</h4>
      <p>Place the shrimp around and on top of the mofongo.</p>
